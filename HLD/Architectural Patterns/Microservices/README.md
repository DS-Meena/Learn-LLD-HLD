# Microservices Architecture 🧩

Microservices architecture is an approach where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate through APIs. 🌐

### Advantages

- Easier to scale individual services 🚀
- Greater flexibility in technology choices for each service 🛠️
- Improved fault isolation 🛡️
- Enables continuous deployment and faster updates 🔄

### Disadvantages

- Increased complexity in managing multiple services 🤯
- Potential for increased latency due to network communication 🐢
- More challenging to maintain data consistency across services 📊

Both architectures have their place in modern software development, with the choice depending on the specific needs and scale of the application. 🤔

# Converting a monolithic into microservices architecture

Converting a monolithic into microservices architecture requires careful evaluation of the business requirements. It involves different phases and each phase can have different patterns to create a micro services.

1. Decomposition

# Decomposition Pattern 🧩

Decomposition patterns are used to break down a monolithic application into smaller, more manageable services. There are three main approaches to decomposition:

1. **Domain-Driven Decomposition 🏢**: This pattern involves breaking down services based on business domains. It aligns the microservices structure with the organization's business capabilities.

    Example: In an e-commerce application 🛒, you might have separate microservices for user management, product catalog, order processing, and inventory management. Each of these represents a distinct business domain.

2. **Subdomain Decomposition 🧩**: This is a further refinement of domain-driven decomposition, where domains are divided into smaller subdomains. This allows for even more granular service definition.

    Example: Within the order processing domain 📦, you could further break it down into subdomains like order creation, payment processing, and shipping management.

3. **Functional Decomposition 🔧**: In this approach, services are separated based on business capabilities. Each microservice is responsible for a specific function or feature of the application.

    Example: For a social media platform 🤳, you might have microservices for user authentication, post creation and retrieval, friend management, and notification services. Each of these represents a specific function or feature of the application.

These decomposition patterns help in creating a more modular and scalable microservices architecture. They allow teams to develop, deploy, and scale services independently, improving overall system flexibility and maintainability. 🚀

# Strangler Pattern

The Strangler pattern, also known as the Strangler Fig pattern 🌳, is a design pattern used in the gradual migration of legacy systems to microservices architecture. 

The Strangler pattern involves incrementally replacing specific pieces of functionality with new applications and services. The new system slowly grows around the old one, eventually replacing it entirely. This approach allows for a gradual transition, reducing risks associated with a complete rewrite. 🔄

Key aspects of the Strangler pattern:

- Gradual Migration: It allows for piece-by-piece migration rather than a complete overhaul. 🧩
- Risk Reduction: By replacing small parts at a time, it reduces the risk of system-wide failures. 🛡️
- Coexistence: The old and new systems can run side by side during the transition period. 🤝
- Incremental Value: Each replaced component can start providing value immediately. 📈
