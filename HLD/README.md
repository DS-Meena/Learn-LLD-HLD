In this part, we will learn about high level design of systems.

Let's understand monolithic and microservices design patterns. These are considered as high level architectural design patterns.

## Monolithic Architecture 🏢

A monolithic architecture is a traditional model where all components of an application are tightly integrated into a single, unified system. 🔒

### Advantages

- Simpler development process for small applications 👨‍💻
- Easier to deploy as a single unit 🚀
- Less complex inter-process communication 🔗

### Disadvantages

- Difficult to scale individual components 📈
- Changes in one part can affect the entire system 🔄
- Limited flexibility in technology choices 🔧

## Microservices Architecture 🧩

Microservices architecture is an approach where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate through APIs. 🌐

### Advantages

- Easier to scale individual services 🚀
- Greater flexibility in technology choices for each service 🛠️
- Improved fault isolation 🛡️
- Enables continuous deployment and faster updates 🔄

### Disadvantages

- Increased complexity in managing multiple services 🤯
- Potential for increased latency due to network communication 🐢
- More challenging to maintain data consistency across services 📊

Both architectures have their place in modern software development, with the choice depending on the specific needs and scale of the application. 🤔
